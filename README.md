Project:    Title Super Cannon Bro
Platform:   Godot
Language:   GDScript
OS: Windows 10







Explanation:
Welcome to Super Cannon Bro where you play Samus, the protagonist of Metroid, in the world of Super Marios Bros Level 1-1 - but with a twist.


Setup:
Run the .exe file within the Super Cannon Bro .zip file on a Window OS computer.
You will enter a rough edition of Level 1-1 from Super Mario Bros - I say rough, because there are no coins or breakable bricks in this version.
Instead, you will immediately be thrown into the fray as a random enemy spawn generator spawns goombas and koopas into the far right quarter of the screen.
A hint can be noted in the top left corner of the screen as you start the game stating that your objective is to ruck through Bowsers' minions as you search for the Bowser triplets themselves.


Controls (keys):
            -- Movement --
Right Arrow:                move right
Left Arrow:                 move left
Up Arrow:                   jump*
Down Arrow:                 crouch**
                                        *can be used to stomp a Koopa (retreated)
                                        ** upon standing atop an upright pipe, and for ~1 sec, this can be used to access short cuts if that pipe has one
            -- Aiming --
'D':                        aim left
'A':                        aim right
Down Arrow + 'A':           aim left (crouched)
Down Arrow + 'D':           aim right (crouched)
            -- Attacking --
Aiming key(s) + Space Bar:  fire armcannon


How you can kill enemies:
Goomba:                     1 cannonball
Koopa:                      1 cannonball causes it to retreat into shell
Koopa (retreated):          1 stomp (note below)
                                hitting a stationary shell with a cannonball will cause it to zip across the platformer, bouncing off of objects
                                hitting  a moving shell will cause it to stop
Bowser:                     ? cannonballs


How you can die:
Goomba:                     death-touch
Koopa:                      death-touch
Koopa (retreated):          death-touch
Bowser:                     death-touch, fireballs


Miscellaneous:
You may find it helpful to look at the Level 1-1 map of Super Mario bros as this was the template used for the majority of the platformer.
Once you find the green portal and enter it you will be in no man's land; that is, the map of Level 1-1 will be of no assistance.
There is a shortcut to reach the Bowser triplets.
